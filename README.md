#vrealize-service-broker

A service broker POC that exposes vRealize blueprint services for use within Cloud Foundry.

##Prerequisites
###Environment
* The vrealize-service-broker requires a PCF that supports the 2.7 service broker API (PCF 1.6 and above). More information on this can be found [here](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/services).
* vrealize-service-broker makes use of a redis datastore to hold metadata and binding information. This can be provided by installing the [redis tile](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-redis).
* The vrealize-service-broker has been developed against the vR 7.0. The vRAutomation REST API end-points must be accessible to the broker.
* A MySQL blueprint should be created and made available to a vR user, and the vR user credentials will be used to communicate with the vR REST API by the broker.
* A local redis service should be installed and run on the development environment. Tips on how to set this up can be found [here](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart).

###Certificates
The vRA API requires SSL: if you are using a self-signed certificate you will need to install it into your local JDK certificate vault. Information on how to do this can be found [here](http://alvinalexander.com/java/java-keytool-keystore-certificates).

This command will display the cert: 
```bash
$ openssl s_client -connect <your.vra.api.server>:443 -showcerts
```
Copy the certificate text into a file called vra.cer. Load the cert via this command:
```bash
$ sudo keytool -keystore <path to your cacerts file> -importcert -alias vra -file <path to your vra.cer file>
```
This certificate must also be provided to the [buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack) that will be used during deployment of the broker. 

Generally, you will fork the java buildpack, add a copy of the cacerts file you updated above, and check the forked buildpack into an accessible github repository. Details on this process are [here](https://johnpfield.wordpress.com/2014/09/19/customizing-the-cloud-foundry-java-buildpack/).

##Building
To checkout and build this project:
```bash
$ cd ~/<your workspace dir>
$ git clone https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/vrealize-service-broker.git
$ cd vrealize-service-broker
$ mvn clean install -DskipTests=true
```

##Testing
Provided the tasks above have been completed, tests are configured by editing the test.properties file in the src/main/resources directory. Ensure that a local redis is installed and running (as per prerequisits, above).

Tests are run in the usual maven manner:
```bash
$ mvn clean install
```

##Deploying to PCF
Create a redis service in your PCF environment:
```bash
$ cf create-service p-redis dedicated-vm vra-broker-repo
```
Edit the manifest.yml file:
```
---
applications:
- name: vrealize-service-broker
  memory: 512M
  instances: 1
  path: target/vrealize-service-broker-0.1.0.jar
  buildpack: <url to your forked java buildpack goes here>
  services: [ vra-broker-repo ]
  env:
    SERVICE_URI: <vR endpoint URL>
    VRA_USER_ID: <vR user name>
    VRA_USER_PASSWORD: <vR password>
    VRA_TENANT: <vR tenant>
```
Push the app:
```bash
$ cf push
```

##Registering the Broker
Once the broker app is pushed successfully, register and validate it as follows:

###Read the broker security token from the logs
Run the following command and look for the broker's security password (there will be a new password generated each time the broker is pushed or restarted).
```bash
$ cf logs vrealize-service-broker --recent
```
Look for a log entry such as:
```
OUT Using default security password: bbc452a4-27e6-4d7b-b23a-4232ee5575345
```

###Register the Broker Instance
General information about this task can be found [here](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/managing-service-brokers.html).
Get the url of the broker application via this command:
```bash
$ cf apps
Getting apps in org yourOrg / space dev as admin...
OK

name                      requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls   
vrealize-service-broker   started           1/1         512M     1G     vrealize-service-broker.your.host   
```
To register the broker:
```bash
$ cf create-service-broker vrealize-service-broker user <the broker password> http://<the broker url>
```
To list service brokers and verify the vR service broker shows up:
```bash
$ cf service-brokers
Getting service brokers as admin...

name                      url   
p-redis                   https://redis-broker.host  
vrealize-service-broker   http://vrealize-service-broker.host
```
To enable service access:
```bash
$ cf service-access
Getting service access as admin...
broker: p-mongodb
   service   plan           access   orgs   
   p-redis   dedicated-vm   all         
   p-redis   shared-vm      all         

broker: vrealize-service-broker
   service      plan         access   orgs   
   MariaDB      MariaDB      none
   
$ cf enable-service-access MariaDB
```
To see the services available in the broker:
```bash
$ cf marketplace
Getting services from marketplace in org jgordon / space dev as admin...
OK

service     plans         description   
MariaDB     MariaDB       created via a vRA blueprint
...
```

##Using the broker
Deploy a simple database application to PCF and have it bind to the services. 

One such app is the [quote-service app](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/quote-service/tree/mysql). Follow the instructions on the github site (for the "mysql" branch) to use this example project to demo the broker.

##Tearing down the broker
To tear the broker down, delete any services bound to it, unregister the broker, and then delete the broker app itself.
```bash
$ cf delete quote-service
$ cf delete-service testds
$ cf delete-service-broker vrealize-service-broker
$ cf delete vrealize-service-broker
$ cf delete-service vra-broker-repo
```
If the broker becomes "stuck," [see this](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/managing-service-brokers.html#purge-service) to knock it out.
